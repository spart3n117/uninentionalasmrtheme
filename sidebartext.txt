*shoutout to /u/spart3n117 for our new theme!

A sub for pure, authentic, and unintentional ASMR videos. Keeping it real since Bob Ross.
&nbsp;

#EXAMPLE:

Guy carving a mask out of wood [scraping, soft speaking, accent]

  &nbsp; 

#RULES:

* ONLY POST UNINTENTIONAL ASMR (no intentional whisper videos, role plays, etc.)

* DO NOT POST MUSIC (to avoid asmr/frisson confusion)

* DO NOT POST PORNO (people complain about it)

* LIMIT THE MASSAGE POSTS (nothing wrong with them, but we want to keep a good variety)
enjoy them tingles :)

* NO REPOSTS (please do not post ASMR content that has already been posted here before, x-posts from /r/asmr are fine though if they're unintentional)
